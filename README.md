# A Simple Perceptron

This repository contains demostrations of a very simple perceptron using the p5 library. The program starts by creating a canvas with 100 randomly placed points divided by a single line. The perceptron first randomly guesses which side of the line the point lies on. Given a boolean return, the perception then "trains" itself to correctly guess the answer. This algorithm is created with the help of Daniel Shiffman's lessons on machine learning.

## Demonstrated Concepts
-Supervised Learning using gradient decent

## Algorithm
1. Provide the perceptron with inputs for which there is a known answer
2. Ask perceptrons to guess an answer
3. Compute the error
4. Adjust the weights accordingly
5. Return to step 1 and repeat
